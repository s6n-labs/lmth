# ðŸ‘‹ LMTH
Say good-byte to HTML, a document markup which is not for applications.

## ðŸš€ Motivation
These days, we usually use HTML to compose our Web applications.
As you know, HTML is a document markup language.
I am considering that the usage is incorrect for HTML's semantics.
Most of Web applications are not document already; it is no longer suitable to use HTML as their language.

This project, LMTH, proposes you to throw HTML away from your application.
You can write applications which work on Web browser, without thinking about the markup.
Only you need to consider is how to layout UI components now.
